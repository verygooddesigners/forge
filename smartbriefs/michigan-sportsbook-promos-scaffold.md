## Example Bonus Descriptions

### First Bet Insurance Style
"New players who sign up and place a first bet of up to $[AMOUNT] will have that bet matched in the same amount in the form of a single bonus bet. I'm a big fan of this [STATE] sportsbook promo as it doesn't carry the requirement that you need to win or lose your first bet."

### Bet & Get (Win Required) Style
"Just sign up and place any $[SMALL_AMOUNT] first wager to earn $[LARGE_AMOUNT] in bonus bets if that bet wins. Note that you'll only unlock that bonus if your bet wins, so find a lock and the $[LARGE_AMOUNT] is yours!"

### Bet & Get (Guaranteed) Style
"New bettors up to $[AMOUNT] in [CURRENCY/BONUS TYPE] just by betting up to $[DAILY_AMOUNT] each day for [X] days. All you have to do is sign up as a new user and place a $1+ first bet each day to earn that same amount in [CURRENCY/BONUS TYPE] each of those days."

### Second Chance Bet Style
"[Sportsbook] offers a great no-sweat bet as a welcome bonus. With the [Sportsbook] bonus code, new users can place a first bet of up to $[AMOUNT], and if that first bet loses, [Sportsbook] will reimburse that loss in bonus bets."
