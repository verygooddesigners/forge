# RotoWrite: Application Overview

## What It Is

RotoWrite is an AI-powered content creation platform designed specifically for sports betting and gaming content production at RotoWire. Unlike generic AI writing tools, RotoWrite combines specialized writer modeling, SEO optimization, and intelligent content workflow management into a single, purpose-built application. The platform enables content strategists to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized articles that maintain authentic writer voice and style while dramatically accelerating the content creation process.

## What Makes It Special

The platform's standout feature is its innovative **Writer Engine**—a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI system that learns and replicates individual writer styles with remarkable precision. Instead of producing generic AI content, RotoWrite trains custom AI models on actual articles written by real strategists, analyzing tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and stylistic patterns. When generating new content, the system retrieves relevant training examples and instructs Claude AI to match the specific writer's voice, producing articles that are virtually indistinguishable from human-written content. This solves the persistent problem of AI-generated content feeling robotic or off-brand—each piece sounds exactly like it came from the credited writer.

The platform's **Brief Builder** provides a structured scaffold system similar to SurferSEO, allowing strategists to create reusable content templates that ensure SEO best practices and consistent formatting across articles. Combined with the **NewsEngine** (powered by Tavily AI), which automatically discovers relevant, recent news stories based on project keywords, RotoWrite eliminates hours of manual research and outlining work. The real-time **SEO Assistant** provides instant optimization feedback, keyword density tracking, and AI-powered improvement suggestions, ensuring every article is primed for search rankings.

## The Complete Workflow

RotoWrite transforms content production from a multi-hour manual process into a streamlined, AI-assisted workflow. Strategists begin by creating a project with a headline, target keywords, and optional topic. They select their personal writer model (pre-trained with their own articles) and choose a relevant brief template that defines the article structure. The NewsEngine automatically gathers current, relevant news sources, while the AI generates a full draft in the strategist's authentic voice, incorporating SEO best practices from the selected brief. The strategist then edits the content using a rich TipTap editor, with the SEO Assistant providing real-time optimization feedback. The entire process—from concept to polished, SEO-optimized article—takes minutes instead of hours, while maintaining the quality and authenticity that readers expect.

## Technical Excellence

Built on a modern tech stack featuring Next.js 14, React 19, Supabase PostgreSQL, and Claude AI (Anthropic's Sonnet model), RotoWrite delivers enterprise-grade performance with sophisticated security features including row-level database security and role-based access control. The platform uses a multi-agent AI architecture where specialized AI agents handle content generation, style analysis, SEO optimization, and quality assurance—each optimized for its specific task. The system includes intelligent auto-save functionality, streaming AI responses for real-time feedback, and a beautiful, intuitive interface built with Shadcn UI components and a violet design theme. The architecture is designed for scalability and cost-efficiency, with monthly AI costs typically under $30 even for high-volume usage.

## Who It's For

RotoWrite serves two primary user types within the RotoWire organization: **Strategists**, who create and manage their own content projects, train their personal writer models, and produce articles; and **Admins**, who oversee the entire system, manage user accounts, configure AI settings, and maintain writer models and brief templates. The platform is specifically tailored for sports betting content—particularly for articles like team analysis, odds comparisons, gambling law guides, and playoff predictions—making it an indispensable tool for the GDC (Gaming and Digital Content) team's mission to rank highly in Google's AI search results while maintaining authentic, engaging content quality.
