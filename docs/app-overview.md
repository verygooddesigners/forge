# Forge: Application Overview

## What It Is

Forge is an AI-powered content creation platform designed specifically for sports betting and gaming content production at RotoWire. Unlike generic AI writing tools, Forge combines specialized writer modeling, SEO optimization, and intelligent content workflow management into a single, purpose-built application. The platform enables content strategists to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized articles that maintain authentic writer voice and style while dramatically accelerating the content creation process.

## What Makes It Special

The platform's standout feature is its innovative **Writer Engine**—a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI system that learns and replicates individual writer styles with remarkable precision. Instead of producing generic AI content, Forge trains custom AI models on actual articles written by real strategists, analyzing tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and stylistic patterns. When generating new content, the system retrieves relevant training examples and instructs Claude AI to match the specific writer's voice, producing articles that are virtually indistinguishable from human-written content. This solves the persistent problem of AI-generated content feeling robotic or off-brand—each piece sounds exactly like it came from the credited writer.

The platform's **Multi-Agent AI System** employs eight specialized AI agents, each optimized for specific tasks: Content Generation, Writer Training, SEO Optimization, Quality Assurance (with LanguageTool integration), Persona & Tone adaptation, Research Orchestrator (research pipeline), Visual Data Extraction, and Fact Verification. Each agent has built-in guardrails preventing it from performing tasks outside its domain, ensuring safe and predictable operation. Admins can tune each agent's behavior, adjust temperature and token limits, and enable/disable agents as needed through a comprehensive Agent Tuner interface.

The platform's **SmartBrief Builder** provides an AI-powered content template system that goes far beyond traditional scaffolds. Strategists create reusable templates that include not just structure, but AI-powered intelligence: they can provide detailed instructions about content type, tone, and requirements, then paste URLs to example articles. The AI analyzes these real-world examples, extracting patterns in structure, formatting, style, and information presentation. This learned context is stored with each SmartBrief, enabling the Content Generation Agent to produce articles that perfectly match established patterns and brand standards. Combined with the **NewsEngine** (powered by Tavily AI), which automatically discovers relevant, recent news stories based on project keywords, Forge eliminates hours of manual research and outlining work. The real-time **SEO Assistant** provides instant optimization feedback, keyword density tracking with live updates as you type, and AI-powered improvement suggestions, ensuring every article is primed for search rankings.

The groundbreaking **NFL Odds Extractor** feature transforms 30+ minutes of manual data entry into a 3-minute automated process. Content strategists simply upload screenshots of ESPN schedules and RotoWire odds matrices, and the Visual Extraction Agent uses Claude Vision to parse the data, generating complete, structured articles with properly formatted tables, prediction sections, and placeholders—all ready to edit and publish. This eliminates transcription errors and ensures consistent formatting week after week.

## The Complete Workflow

Forge transforms content production from a multi-hour manual process into a streamlined, AI-assisted workflow. Strategists begin by creating a project with a headline, target keywords, and optional topic. They select their personal writer model (pre-trained with their own articles) and choose a relevant brief template that defines the article structure. The NewsEngine automatically gathers current, relevant news sources, while the AI generates a full draft in the strategist's authentic voice, incorporating SEO best practices from the selected brief. The strategist then edits the content using a rich TipTap editor, with the SEO Assistant providing real-time optimization feedback. The entire process—from concept to polished, SEO-optimized article—takes minutes instead of hours, while maintaining the quality and authenticity that readers expect.

## Technical Excellence

Built on a modern tech stack featuring Next.js 14, React 19, Supabase PostgreSQL, and Claude AI (Anthropic's Sonnet 4 model), Forge delivers enterprise-grade performance with sophisticated security features including row-level database security and role-based access control. The platform uses a multi-agent AI architecture where seven specialized AI agents handle content generation, style analysis, SEO optimization, quality assurance, persona adaptation, workflow orchestration, and visual data extraction—each optimized for its specific task with built-in guardrails. All agent configurations are stored in the database and can be tuned in real-time through the Admin Dashboard without code deployments.

The system includes intelligent auto-save functionality with debouncing, streaming AI responses for real-time feedback, live keyword tracking that updates as you type, and a sophisticated export system with CMS-ready formatting and critical safety warnings. The Visual Extraction Agent supports both Claude Vision (primary) and GPT-4o Vision (fallback) for maximum reliability when processing images. The beautiful, intuitive interface is built with Shadcn UI components featuring a violet design theme, TipTap rich text editor, and responsive layouts. The architecture is designed for scalability and cost-efficiency, with monthly AI costs typically under $30 even for high-volume usage.

## Who It's For

Forge serves two primary user types within the RotoWire organization: **Strategists**, who create and manage their own content projects, train their personal writer models, and produce articles; and **Admins**, who oversee the entire system, manage user accounts, configure AI settings, and maintain writer models and brief templates. The platform is specifically tailored for sports betting content—particularly for articles like team analysis, odds comparisons, gambling law guides, and playoff predictions—making it an indispensable tool for the GDC (Gaming and Digital Content) team's mission to rank highly in Google's AI search results while maintaining authentic, engaging content quality.
