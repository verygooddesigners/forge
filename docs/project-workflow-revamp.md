# PROJECT WORKFLOW OVERHAUL

Here is the way I want the workflow to go: 

1. User clicks the Create New Project button (either on the left-side Main Menu or on the Projects screen).
2. The New Project Wizard opens on a new screen - not a dashboard. Instead of one screen for each question in the wizard, I want the entire Create New Project fields to be on a single screen. So we'd have a new screen called Create New Project, and on that screen would be: 
    - Project Name: Short text field
    - Project Description: Long text field. (This is a new field)
    - H1 for the content being created: Short text field
    - Primary Keyword: A single text field
    - Secondary Keywords: Shows a single field and, on the right side of the field, a colored square with a white plus icon. When the user types a keyword and then either types a comma, clicks the Plus icon or hits enter, it adds that secondary keyword to a list of keywords that appears underneath the Add Keyword field. The added keywords should show up as labels, design-wise.
    - Additional Details: Long text field.
    - Writer Model: A dropdown selection list of the Writer Models available to the user
    - SmartBrief Selection: A dropdown selection list of SmartBriefs that are available to select. SmartBriefs the user has created appear in the top section; SmartBriefs created and shared by other users appear in the bottom section. When the user selects a SmartBrief, I want a preview of that SmartBrief to appear in a window to the right of the selection area. The preview should show all content from the SmartBrief scaffold, but in a much smaller font, and the preview window should be scrollable both vertically and horizontally.
    - Word Count: Number field. The user types in the desired word count of the generated content.
