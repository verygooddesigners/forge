# SUGGEST SECONDARY KEYWORDS

On the new Create New Project screen, add a small text link underneath the Secondary Keywords input field that says "Suggest Keywords". 

When clicked: 

1. A callout box expands below the Secondary Keyword input field. This callout box should adhere to the design system and have a lightly-colored background.
2. The AI Agents Team--primarily led by the SEO Agent-- bundle the Project Name, Project Description, H1 Heading and Primary Keyword together and conduct an analysis of potential secondary keywords that would be highly useful in helping the Search Engine ranking of this piece of content. 
3. The resulting list of keywords are inserted into the callout box. They should look like labels. When the user clicks the keyword label, it's added to the list of secondary keywords, and the color of the label changes to a gray to indicate it's been used.
