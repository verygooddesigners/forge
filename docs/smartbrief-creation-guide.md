# SmartBrief Creation Guide

## What is a SmartBrief?

A **SmartBrief** is an AI-powered content template that defines:
- **Structure:** Heading hierarchy and required sections
- **Style:** Tone, voice, and formatting preferences  
- **Context:** What information should be included
- **Examples:** Real-world articles the AI learns from

SmartBriefs ensure consistency across all your content while allowing the AI to adapt to different topics within your defined structure.
