    "content": "Big changes have hit the Valley for the Phoenix Suns in the 2025–26 NBA season. After a frustrating and underwhelming 2024–25 run, the front office hit the reset button, starting with a blockbuster trade that sent Kevin Durant packing and a fresh hire in new head coach Jordan Ott.\n\nDespite low preseason expectations, the Suns are doing surprisingly well, sitting in seventh place in the Western Conference and winning eight of their last ten games with a 24-16 record. If the Suns' roster continues to deliver, Phoenix could fight its way back into playoff contention for the first time since 2021. We'll provide all of the latest futures odds from Arizona sports betting operators throughout the 2025-26 season.\n\nLatest Suns Odds & Futures: Playoffs, Championship, & More\nEarly odds didn't favor the Suns, but a few big wins have improved their outlook. After finishing 11th in the Western Conference last season and missing the Play-In tournament, the team is counting on a new coaching staff and a revamped roster to spark a turnaround and build the foundation for a more sustainable, competitive future.\n\n⭐ Odds to Win Pacific Division:\t+200 (33.3% chance)\n🚨 Odds to Make Playoffs:\t-370 (78.7% chance)\n🥇 Odds to Win Western Conference:\t+15000 (0.7% chance)\n🏆 NBA Championship Odds:\t+35000 (0.28% chance)\n🏀 Devin Booker MVP Odds\tOTB\nOdds provided by DraftKings Sportsbook\n\nCurrent 2025-26 Suns NBA Finals Odds\nThe Suns' NBA Finals odds have improved since the start of the season at DraftKings Arizona. But Phoenix is still a clear long shot to win the NBA championship, with sportsbooks showing little confidence in a deep playoff run. With first-time head coach Jordan Ott at the helm, a new starting five, and a younger, unproven roster, Phoenix is embracing a full reset as it looks to build for the future rather than chase immediate title contention. The Suns’ roster has delivered so far, and they sit second in the Pacific Division, just one game behind the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThere are various Arizona sports betting apps with 2025-26 odds for the Phoenix Suns and every other NBA team.\n\nSuns Chances to Make Playoffs and Win NBA Championship\nThe Suns' roster is centered around rising young stars alongside veterans Devin Booker and Dillon Brooks. Despite this shakeup, sportsbooks have pegged Phoenix as underdogs across the board. Big wins, however, have improved the Suns’ odds to make the playoffs and win the division. They are embarking on a six-game road trip from January 13–23, then return home on January 25.\n\n⭐ Win Pacific Division:\t33.3% (+200)\n🚨 Make NBA Playoffs:\t78.7% (-370)\n🥇 Win Western Conference:\t0.66% (+15000)\n🏆 Win NBA Championship: \t0.28% chance (+35000)\n✅ Last Updated: \tJanuary 17, 2026\nThe 2024-25 Suns starting 5 were one of the best when healthy. After missing both the Play-In Tournament and the playoffs, the Phoenix Suns wasted no time reshaping their roster this offseason. Injuries have been a familiar challenge for Phoenix, and they’ve surfaced again this season. Jalen Green has been sidelined since November, but his return could be coming soon, as he’s already started taking live reps. The Suns are aiming for him to be back around mid-January.\n\nWhere Can I Bet on the Phoenix Suns?\nYou can legally bet on the Suns and the entire NBA at all licensed Arizona sportsbooks as long as you’re 21 or older and within state lines. Beyond futures like NBA Champion, conference winner, division winner, and major awards, you can also bet on individual Suns games. Here are a few notable sportsbooks with good Arizona sportsbook promos to get started on NBA betting:\n\nHow Many Times Have the Suns Won the NBA Championship?\nNone. They lost 4-2 to the Celtics in 1976, 4-2 to the Bulls in 1993, and 4-2 to the Bucks in 2021.\n\nHow Many Times Have the Suns Made the NBA Finals?\nThree times, once when they were still relative newcomers to the NBA, again when Charles Barkley was leading the team, and recently when they held a 2-0 lead but lost the next four to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.\n\nHow Many Times Have the Suns Made the Playoffs?\nPhoenix has made the playoffs 33 times, with the longest non-playoff drought happening from 2010 until 2020, ending that drought by making a run to the NBA Finals.",

Exchanges have market makers, betting syndicates & trading firms setting lines on their platforms. These exchanges have ONLY grown more popular & active...\nThese exchanges are extremely sharp when they are highly liquid (have a lot of activity). When this is the case, you want to bet ALL \"crossed market bets\" (or arbitrage plays) to them.\nBy definition, if there's arbitrage (aka risk-free betting opportunity), one SIDE of the arbitrage opportunity HAS to be a profitable (+EV) bet. If you can get BOTH outcomes to ensure a profit, then one SIDE of the arbitrage play is an insanely profitable wager.\nThe insanely profitable side is going to be on the soft (aka beatable) book. You want to bet on this side, commonly MGM, FanDuel, PrizePicks, Underdog Fantasy, DraftKings, Hard Rock, Dabble, when they are \"crossed\" with NoVig and ProphetX.\nThe more \"liquid\" or active the market is, the higher confidence the bet you are placing is profitable.\nAll that YOU have to do is place the bets, which is EXTREMELY easy with \"one click bet\" that takes you right to it. The Sharp Money Pro tool handles all the hard work for you - you just have the click the \"one click bet\" button.\nThis is the time to take your sportsbetting to the next level.

This time of the year there are endless opportunities where you can bet on both sides of a game to generate a profit no matter what! This style of betting is known as arbitrage betting and users are making hundreds, and for some, thousands of dollars a night!\n\n$23,000 in 22 days ($1,045/day 💰)\n\nImage\nClick Here To Try Arbitrage Betting\nThis user is having a massive month and is up more than $23,000 in 22 days. The OddsJam Arbitrage Tool notifies users of thousands of profitable betting opportunities daily. Results like these are starting to become the norm for arbitrage bettors and I can't wait to see what this week has in store!\n\nA shot at $82 💰\n\nImage\nImage\nThere were an insane amount of arbitrage opportunities yesterday, and even more middle bets. Middle betting is a style of betting where you place bets on BOTH sides of an outcome when there is a difference in lines which could result in winning both bets. This style of betting gets even better when you can lock in an arbitrage (a profit regardless of the outcome) along with a middle opportunity. Let's break one down...\n\nThe Math:\n\nOn Fliff, we bet $30\n\nOn OnyxOdds, we bet $40\n\nIn total, we invested $70\n\nThere are three possible outcomes...\n\nKyle Kuzma records more than 19.5 PRA's (Points/Rebounds/Assists): Fliff wins, OnyxOdds loses, we receive a payout of $75, and a profit of $5 ($75 payout - $70 invested)\nKyle Kuzma records less than 20.5 PRA's (Points/Rebounds/Assists): OnyxOdds wins, Fliff loses, we receive a payout of $77, and a profit of $7 ($77 payout - $70 invested)\nKyle Kuzma records exactly 20 PRA's (Points/Rebounds/Assists): Fliff wins, OnyxOdds wins, we receive a payout of $152, and a profit of $82.\nRegardless of the outcome, we're going to walk away with a guaranteed $5 or $7, but in the event that Kuzma records exactly 20 PRA's we're going to walk away with a $82 profit! The OddsJam Arbitrage Tool identified this situation where we were able to profit $5 or $7 or potentially win both for a huge payout!\n\nIf you want to take a stab at generating a second income from sportsbetting, click the button below to get a free 7-day trial of the OddsJam Arbitrage Tool:\n\nClick Here To Try Arbitrage Betting\nBest,\n\nRandall\n\nP.S WATCH Alex give a step by step tutorial on arbitrage betting!\n\nImage\nImage\nImage\nClick Here To Try Arbitrage Betting\n",
