It doesn’t moralize about gambling, nor does it deeply discuss regulation, harm or social implications. Instead, it stays neutral and transactional: “here are features to look at,” “here are sign-up offers,” “here are strengths/weaknesses.” \nThe Independent\n\nIt positions itself as “up-to-date” (November 2025) and tries to convey authority using a combination of first-hand testing, third-party data, and licensing checks (via the UK regulator, UK Gambling Commission — “UKGC”).

Not only did they lose the game, but lost guard Austin Reaves, who was having a great season, to a calf injury. Phoenix (14-11, 15-9-1 ATS) was crushed by OKC in their NBA Cup quarterfinal, 138-89. These teams last met on Dec. 1 with the Suns winning 125-108 on the road as a 5.5-point underdog. The early odds have the Lakers as a 2.5-point favorite with the total at 229.5.

This will be an interesting matchup against Suns’ Royce O’Neale in the low post, to which Kleber could find a strong matchup. Furthermore, the Lakers are the much taller lineup, so the Suns will have to ramp-up the physicality to send a message during this first meeting. [...] The Phoenix Suns are seventh in the Western Conference following their most recent 130-112 loss to the Denver Nuggets. After winning eight of nine games, the Suns have dropped three of their last four and are hoping to bounce back as the underdogs, meeting Los Angeles for the first time this season.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are second in the Western Conference, recently taking down the Dallas Mavericks 129-119.

[...] The Phoenix Suns are looking like a Play-in team, but they need Devin Booker to keep balling out to stay on the heels of the Top 6 in the West.\n\nThough Booker limped off with a groin injury against the Los Angeles Lakers at the start of the month, he’s been back with a bang in his last three outings — scoring 25+ points in each of those contests.\n\nBooker is coming off a 38-point masterclass against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday, shooting an efficient 13-for-27. That’s a great sign for Phoenix — and it spells trouble for an L.A. team with a lack of perimeter stoppers.",

You should use the expected value calculator to ensure you are only placing bets where you have positive expected value. For example, imagine you’re flipping a coin with a friend; that coin is 50/50 to land on heads or tails. At +100 odds, the expected value of a $100 coin flip is equal to $0. Why flip the coin? However, if you are getting +110 odds, then the EV of a $100 coin flip is equal to $5. You should flip that coin as much as you can! [...] sportsbook. The sharpest sportsbook in the world has Rams -105 moneyline odds and their opponent moneyline -105 odds as well. This means that the no vig “fair” odds are +100, and both teams have an implied win percentage of 50%. The expected value of a $100 bet on Rams +110 is equal to $5, as seen in the calculator. The formula for expected value = (fair win probability) x (profit if win) - (fair loss probability) x (stake). This is the formula in the OddsJam sports betting expected value calculator. Using the example above, the EV of our bet would be $5 using the no vig fair odds from the sharpest sportsbook in the world: 50% x $110 - 50% x $100.

The expected value calculator requires three inputs: your stake, the odds of your wager, and the implied win percentage of your bet. The implied win percentage can be from a sports betting model or calculated using the no vig “fair” odds from a sharp sportsbook. Finding the no vig “fair” odds from the sharpest sportsbook in the world (you know what it is!) is the industry standard for fair win probability. Many bettors determine a proper stake using the Kelly Criterion. We’ll go through an example with the expected value calculator.

You should use the expected value calculator to ensure you are only placing bets where you have positive expected value. For example, imagine you’re flipping a coin with a friend; that coin is 50/50 to land on heads or tails. At +100 odds, the expected value of a $100 coin flip is equal to $0. Why flip the coin? However, if you are getting +110 odds, then the EV of a $100 coin flip is equal to $5. You should flip that coin as much as you can! [...] sportsbook. The sharpest sportsbook in the world has Rams -105 moneyline odds and their opponent moneyline -105 odds as well. This means that the no vig “fair” odds are +100, and both teams have an implied win percentage of 50%. The expected value of a $100 bet on Rams +110 is equal to $5, as seen in the calculator. The formula for expected value = (fair win probability) x (profit if win) - (fair loss probability) x (stake). This is the formula in the OddsJam sports betting expected value calculator. Using the example above, the EV of our bet would be $5 using the no vig fair odds from the sharpest sportsbook in the world: 50% x $110 - 50% x $100. This bet is profitable by $5, and placing positive expected value (+EV) bets like this one will make you a lot of money in the long run as a [...] The OddsJam expected value calculator (EV calculator) determines your profit margin over the sportsbook for a given wager. The expected value calculator requires three inputs: your stake, the odds of your wager, and the implied win percentage of your bet. The implied win percentage can be from a sports betting model or calculated using the no vig “fair” odds from a sharp sportsbook. Finding the no vig “fair” odds from the sharpest sportsbook in the world (you know what it is!) is the industry standard for fair win probability. Many bettors determine a proper stake using the Kelly Criterion. We’ll go through an example with the expected value calculator. Let’s say you bet $100 on the Los Angeles Rams +110 moneyline odds on BetFred sportsbook. The sharpest sportsbook in the world has Rams",

Make sure you're subscribing if you're new. We got a ton of content always coming your way. And now, let's go ahead and jump in. How to find these EV bets. And it starts with not betting just based on hunches and instead betting based on value. Plus, EV means positive expected value. And finding it is actually a lot easier than most people might think. Let's start on the market mispricing. Books are often opening up lines early, but they're not always efficient when doing so. Sometimes they miss, sometimes the markets react slowly. That's where the edge lies. Matt, do you have any examples of what of this that you can [...] business model and what the books are doing. So you have to have multiple outs. I mean that that just goes back to betting 101. Got to have multiple outs and you got to know what your book's going to take for an action standpoint. But numbers in betting into the best numbers. If the market is set at, you know, over 101 yards and you find 95, that's huge. That's what we're talking about in terms of EV. That's an EV number that you have to take advantage of. You can also find plus EV tickets with correlation. If you believe one thing will happen, certain other outcomes become more likely. That's correlation in a nutshell. And it really is the key to finding some plus EV angles, especially if you're playing in that props or SGP market.
