# DO TASKS

When given this command, you will: 

1. **Read tasks.md** and check the Active Tasks section for any `[PENDING]` tasks
2. **Analyze and prioritize** tasks based on:
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Impact and urgency
   - Complexity and estimated effort
   - Logical workflow order
3. **Process tasks sequentially**:
   - Update status from `[PENDING]` to `[IN PROGRESS]` when starting work
   - Complete the task implementation
   - Update status to `[DONE]` when completed
   - If blocked, update to `[BLOCKED]` with a clear reason
4. **Report progress** after each task completion
5. **Continue until** all `[PENDING]` tasks are processed

## Status Prefixes

- `[PENDING]` - New task, not started
- `[IN PROGRESS]` - Currently being worked on
- `[DONE]` - Completed successfully
- `[BLOCKED]` - Cannot complete (include reason in task description)

## Workflow Notes

- Tasks stay in the Active Tasks section even when `[DONE]`
- Completed tasks are archived manually or on request
- Focus on `[PENDING]` tasks first, but can resume `[IN PROGRESS]` tasks if found
- If multiple `[PENDING]` tasks exist, reorder them by priority before starting
- Report clearly if any task is blocked and why
