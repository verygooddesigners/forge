# DO TASKS

When given this command, you will: 

1. Check tasks.md to see if there are any new tasks I've added
2. Analyze the tasks for workload, priority and the optimal order to complete them in and re-order them according to your analysis
3. Work through your newly re-ordered task list
4. When a task is completed, you will put an X in the [] on the task and move the task to the COMPLETED section at the bottom
5. If a task can't be completed for any reason, you will move it to the ON HOLD section and inform me why it can't be completed
