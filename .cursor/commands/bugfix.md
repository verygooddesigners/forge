This command will have the agent: 

1. Ask me to describe the bug, or to paste the error message I received
2. Ask me what I was trying to do when error happened
3. The agent will take that information and
    1. Figure out what went wrong
    2. Come up with a plan to fix it
    3. Ensure that the fix will not break anything else, cause any other errors or make any design changes (unless those design changes are part of the bug and are approved by the user)
4. Once those three conditions are met, the agent will fix the bug.
