# Cursor AI Rules for Forge

When you see a file named TASK_*.md in the .spark/ directory:
- This is an active task from Spark that needs immediate completion
- Start working on it automatically without waiting for user confirmation
- Read the task description and begin implementation immediately
- **CRITICAL**: After completing each task, you MUST call the spark_update_task MCP tool
- The MCP tool is already configured - just call it directly with the task ID
- Format: spark_update_task task_id="xxx" updates={"status": "done"}
- This updates the Spark UI in real-time so the user can see progress

Auto-start tasks in .spark/ directory. Always call spark_update_task when done.
