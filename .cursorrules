# Cursor AI Rules for Forge

When you see a file named TASK_*.md in the .spark/ directory:
- This is an active task from Spark that needs immediate completion
- Start working on it automatically without waiting for user confirmation
- Read the task description and begin implementation immediately
- **CRITICAL**: After completing each task, you MUST call the spark_update_task MCP tool
- The MCP tool is already configured - just call it directly with the task ID
- Format: spark_update_task task_id="xxx" updates={"status": "done"}
- This updates the Spark UI in real-time so the user can see progress

Auto-start tasks in .spark/ directory. Always call spark_update_task when done.

## Ship It (MANDATORY after completing work)

**You MUST automatically run the full Ship It workflow when you are done building something or completing a task.** Do not ask the user — run it every time.

1. Mark Spark task complete (if the work was for a .spark/TASK_*.md task).
2. Bump version in package.json, PROJECT_STATUS.md, README.md.
3. Add/update CHANGELOG.md with what shipped.
4. Call mcp_spark_spark_update_project (project_id 7bf75473-0a06-469c-9fd2-2229efff76e0) with the new version.
5. Commit and push to origin main.

Full details in `.cursor/rules/ship-it.mdc`. Running "Ship It" command also triggers this.
