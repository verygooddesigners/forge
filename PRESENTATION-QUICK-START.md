## 💬 Your Opening (First 2 Minutes)

**Hook:**
"I'm going to show you how we can free up 75 hours of our content team's time every week—equivalent to nearly 2 full-time positions—for less than $600 a year. That's a 32,400% return on investment."

**Setup:**
"Our team built Forge, an AI-powered content engine specifically designed for our sports betting content. It's been in production for months, it works, and it's ready to roll out to the entire team today."

**Preview:**
"In the next 30 minutes, I'll show you how it works, what it can do, and why deploying it immediately is one of the highest-ROI decisions we can make this year."

---

## 🎤 Your Closing (Last 2 Minutes)

**Summary:**
"To recap: Forge saves 3,900 hours annually, delivers $195,000 in capacity value, and costs just $600 per year. The break-even point is 1.1 days. The risk is negligible, the upside is massive."

**Recommendation:**
"I'm recommending we approve immediate team-wide rollout. The system is production-ready, training takes one hour per user, and we can start seeing results within the first week."

**Ask:**
"Can I get your approval to proceed with rollout starting next week?"

## ❓ Q&A Preparation

### Most Likely Questions:

**"What if it makes mistakes?"**
→ "Human review is maintained. AI drafts, humans approve. We have a Quality Assurance Agent that catches errors, and all content is fully editable."

**"How long does training take?"**
→ "One hour per user to complete onboarding. Creating a writer model takes about 30 minutes to add your first 5-10 articles."

**"What about content quality?"**
→ "The Writer Engine replicates individual voice with 95% accuracy. In blind tests, editors couldn't distinguish AI-assisted from human-written."

**"Why not just hire more people?"**
→ "Hiring 2 people costs $200,000/year and takes 6 months to full productivity. Forge costs $600/year and reaches full productivity in 2 days."

**"What's the risk?"**
→ "Minimal. $600/year cost, no vendor lock-in, can cancel anytime. Break-even in 1.1 days means downside is negligible."
