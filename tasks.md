# TASKS

- Build the Dark Mode and wire it up to the various places where you can toggle between light and dark modes.

- Add a new Writer Models section to the Admin area. It can be under the existing AI & Content header. I want to be able to create Writer Models there and also assign them to existing user accounts.

- Update the User Management tool in the Admin area to allow me to assign a writer model to each created user. If a user logs in and they have an assigned Writer Model, the writer model select box on new project setups will default to their assigned Writer Model. 

- 

- Put a Light/Dark Mode toggle - with an icon to the left of the toggle, but no text description - right above the user menu which sits at the very bottom of the MenuBar on the left.

## SHARING/COLLAB

Build and wire up the sharing and collaboration tools for projects and smartbriefs. Right now, some of the tools look like they're there, but they don't work. For instance, the SmartBriefs screen - I've shared several SmartBriefs, but none of them show up in the Shared SmartBriefs folder.


# FIXES

# UI
- Remove the "Extract NFL Odds" Quick Action card from the homepage. Replace that card with a card that links to both the User Guide and the SmartBriefs Guide.
- On the SmartBriefs Dashboard, make the "SmartBrief AutoBuilder" button icon and button outline the primary purple color. 
- Make the Suggested Keywords labels and font size smaller - and ensure it stays contained within the container its in. Right now it spills over the outside.
