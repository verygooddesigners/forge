## Your Instructions

**START WORKING NOW.** Complete this task by:

1. Reading relevant files from this codebase
2. Understanding the current implementation
3. Writing/updating code to complete the task
4. Testing your changes logically
5. **CRITICAL**: When done, mark the task complete (see below)

**Important:**
- This is a critical priority task
- Write production-quality code
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Be thorough and test your logic

### Mark Task Complete (REQUIRED)

When you finish this task, you **MUST** call the Spark MCP tool so the task card moves to Done in Spark.

The MCP tool is named **mcp__spark__spark_update_task**. Call it with these parameters:
- task_id: "dffc65ba-86ee-42d4-8e2d-3061407a3680"
- updates: {"status": "done"}

This is an MCP tool call — invoke the tool directly, do NOT just write it in a comment or code block.
The Spark UI polls every few seconds and the task card will move to Done automatically.

**BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW.**
