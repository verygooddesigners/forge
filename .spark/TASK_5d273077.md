# Task: Generate Content Button not working when starting new project

**Status:** to_do
**Priority:** critical
**Feature Area:** General
**Task ID:** 5d273077-b1db-4a2e-ad49-0993dec484d6
**Project:** Forge

## Description

When I start a new project and finish the setup wizard (choosing smartbrief, writer model, etc), the Generate Content button needs to be active. The way the workflow goes is this: 

1. 1. Do the setup wizard.
2. Click the generate content button so that the editor fills up with content.
3. Research the story so that it fact checks using the fact checking agent all of the content in the story.

Feel free to adapt and change this a little but to make it more intuitive. But the most important thing is, when the setup wizard is finished, the Generate Content button should be active and working.

## Your Instructions

**START WORKING NOW.** Complete this task by:

1. Reading relevant files from this codebase
2. Understanding the current implementation
3. Writing/updating code to complete the task
4. Testing your changes logically
5. **CRITICAL**: When done, mark the task complete (see below)

**Important:**
- This is a critical priority task
- Write production-quality code
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Be thorough and test your logic

### Mark Task Complete (REQUIRED)

When you finish this task, you **MUST** call the Spark MCP tool so the task card moves to Done in Spark.

The MCP tool is named **mcp__spark__spark_update_task**. Call it with these parameters:
- task_id: "5d273077-b1db-4a2e-ad49-0993dec484d6"
- updates: {"status": "done"}

This is an MCP tool call — invoke the tool directly, do NOT just write it in a comment or code block.
The Spark UI polls every few seconds and the task card will move to Done automatically.

**BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW.**
