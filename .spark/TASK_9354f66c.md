# Task: Create Tools infrastructure

**Status:** to_do
**Priority:** high
**Feature Area:** Tools
**Task ID:** 9354f66c-1315-4207-a6d0-b4fd93eeb72d
**Project:** Forge

## Description

I want people to be able to develop plugins/tools for Forge, which will extend it and add more powerfuf capabilitieis to it. First I need to brainstorm this with Claude Code, and then it will develop it. 

I want: 

- Architecture and documentation that will allow anyone to develop Tools (plugins) for Forge
- A Forge Tools Marketplace, where approved tools are listed as cards and can be activated by users by pressing an Activate button
- A Forge Tools admin dashboard, only available to the Super Admin, where i can review Tools submitted by developers and approve them for inclusion in the Forge tools market. 

Do not build yet - lets brainstorm features and functions

## Your Instructions

**START WORKING NOW.** Complete this task by:

1. Reading relevant files from this codebase
2. Understanding the current implementation
3. Writing/updating code to complete the task
4. Testing your changes logically
5. **CRITICAL**: When done, mark the task complete (see below)

**Important:**
- This is a high priority task
- Write production-quality code
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Be thorough and test your logic

### Mark Task Complete (REQUIRED)

When you finish this task, you **MUST** call the Spark MCP tool so the task card moves to Done in Spark.

The MCP tool is named **mcp__spark__spark_update_task**. Call it with these parameters:
- task_id: "9354f66c-1315-4207-a6d0-b4fd93eeb72d"
- updates: {"status": "done"}

This is an MCP tool call — invoke the tool directly, do NOT just write it in a comment or code block.
The Spark UI polls every few seconds and the task card will move to Done automatically.

**BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW.**
