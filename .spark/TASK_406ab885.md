# Task: Still can't Save SmartBriefs

**Status:** to_do
**Priority:** critical
**Feature Area:** General
**Task ID:** 406ab885-dd64-4450-a243-56cb497992f5
**Project:** Forge

## Description

Tried to save a new SmartBrief again and got this error: 

Could not find the 'description' column of 'briefs' in the schema cache

I need you to take your time, examine everything, figure out what is wrong, fix it, test it, and keep doing this until it's fixed.

## Your Instructions

**START WORKING NOW.** Complete this task by:

1. Reading relevant files from this codebase
2. Understanding the current implementation
3. Writing/updating code to complete the task
4. Testing your changes logically
5. **CRITICAL**: When done, mark the task complete (see below)

**Important:**
- This is a critical priority task
- Write production-quality code
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Be thorough and test your logic

### Mark Task Complete (REQUIRED)

When you finish this task, you **MUST** call the Spark MCP tool so the task card moves to Done in Spark.

The MCP tool is named **mcp__spark__spark_update_task**. Call it with these parameters:
- task_id: "406ab885-dd64-4450-a243-56cb497992f5"
- updates: {"status": "done"}

This is an MCP tool call — invoke the tool directly, do NOT just write it in a comment or code block.
The Spark UI polls every few seconds and the task card will move to Done automatically.

**BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW.**
