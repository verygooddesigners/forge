# Task: Can't Select Writer Model in New Project Wizard

**Status:** to_do
**Priority:** medium
**Feature Area:** General
**Task ID:** c987668a-46c2-4127-9ff7-bb08ba45357c
**Project:** Forge

## Description

When I get to the modal that allows me to choose my rider model in the new project wizard setup, the only one that's available is Bryan Stevens. It used to be a drop-down box. Because I'm an administrator, I should be able to choose all of the rider models. If I were a logged-in user, say Bryan Stevens, then I should only be able to choose the Bryan Stevens model, but because I'm an admin, I should be able to select all of them.

## Your Instructions

**START WORKING NOW.** Complete this task by:

1. Reading relevant files from this codebase
2. Understanding the current implementation
3. Writing/updating code to complete the task
4. Testing your changes logically
5. **CRITICAL**: When done, mark the task complete (see below)

**Important:**
- This is a medium priority task
- Write production-quality code
- Follow the project's existing patterns
- Be thorough and test your logic

### Mark Task Complete (REQUIRED)

When you finish this task, you **MUST** call the Spark MCP tool so the task card moves to Done in Spark.

The MCP tool is named **mcp__spark__spark_update_task**. Call it with these parameters:
- task_id: "c987668a-46c2-4127-9ff7-bb08ba45357c"
- updates: {"status": "done"}

This is an MCP tool call — invoke the tool directly, do NOT just write it in a comment or code block.
The Spark UI polls every few seconds and the task card will move to Done automatically.

**BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW.**
